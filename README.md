[Article: What Does a Software Engineer Do?](https://www.coursera.org/articles/software-engineer)


I thought this article was interesting because they talk about the day to day tasks of what software engineers do. I like that there are many resources related to software engineering, such as how to become a SWE, certifications, and other useful information such as different career paths.


Joshua Forlenza: I thought this article was really interesting as well. I feel like it's a helpful resource for students who are beginning the job search and looking to figure out what exactly a software engineering career entails.


Stella Zhang: The article classes software engineers into two main categories: systems engineers and application developers. I'm curious to see how much material in this course pertains to either or both of these specializations.


Wei Luo: So that is what we are looking at in the future career!

**Hojong Shim**: Thank you for your insight! I think this was a very useful guide on what software engineering is really like -- I will also keep these tips in mind for the future.
